# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data, specifically targeting user opinions and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets/posts, visualize the sentiment distribution, and identify common themes associated with different sentiments.

### 1.2 Scope
This project involves the following key components:
- Collecting and preprocessing social media data (e.g., tweets or posts).
- Applying sentiment analysis to classify the data into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- Visualizing sentiment distribution and identifying common themes using word clouds and other visual techniques.
- Providing actionable insights into public opinion and trends related to a particular topic or brand.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The process of determining whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **TextBlob**: A Python library used for processing textual data, including sentiment analysis.
- **Word Cloud**: A visualization of the most frequent words in a dataset, where word size is proportional to frequency.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface used for retrieving social media data.

### 1.4 References
- Python Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `TextBlob`, `WordCloud`
- Twitter API Documentation: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This project is a standalone system that will take a dataset of social media posts (specifically tweets) as input, process the text for sentiment analysis, and output visualizations of sentiment distribution and word clouds for each sentiment type (positive, negative, neutral).

### 2.2 Product Functions
The product will:
1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load a CSV or API dataset of tweets or social media posts, clean the text (remove URLs, special characters, and stop words).
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use TextBlob to classify each post as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. **Sentiment Distribution Visualization**: Display the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) as a bar or pie chart.
4. **Word Cloud Generation**: Create word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
5. **Entity Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment by entities (brands, topics) mentioned in the posts.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **Data Scientists**: Will use the system to analyze public sentiment regarding various topics or brands.
- **Marketers**: Will use insights to shape campaigns based on customer sentiment.
- **Researchers**: Will leverage the analysis to understand trends in social media and public opinion.

### 2.4 Constraints
- The system will be limited to processing datasets in CSV format, or data obtained through APIs like Twitter.
- The sentiment analysis will use a pre-trained model (TextBlob) for simplicity. Fine-tuned models for specific industries or topics may be considered in future iterations.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Description**: This feature involves loading social media data from a CSV file or an API, then cleaning and preprocessing the text.
- **Inputs**: A CSV file containing social media posts or data fetched via API.
- **Outputs**: A cleaned dataset with unnecessary content (URLs, mentions, punctuation) removed.

### 3.2 Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: Apply sentiment analysis to classify each post’s sentiment.
- **Inputs**: Cleaned text data.
- **Outputs**: A new column in the dataset with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).

### 3.3 Sentiment Distribution Visualization
- **Description**: Generate a bar or pie chart to show the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
- **Inputs**: The sentiment-labeled dataset.
- **Outputs**: A visual chart displaying the sentiment distribution.

### 3.4 Word Cloud Generation
- **Description**: Generate word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Inputs**: The sentiment-labeled dataset.
- **Outputs**: Three word clouds—one for each sentiment type.

### 3.5 Sentiment by Entity
- **Description**: Analyze and visualize sentiment distribution by specific entities (e.g., brands, topics).
- **Inputs**: A dataset containing mentions of entities.
- **Outputs**: A bar chart displaying sentiment distribution per entity.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interface
The system will not have a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI). The analysis and visualizations will be displayed within a Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle notebook interface.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
No specific hardware requirements beyond the computing resources available in the Kaggle environment (e.g., CPU, RAM).

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle environment for executing code
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `TextBlob`, `WordCloud`

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces
The system may interact with social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to collect data if applicable.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
The system should process and analyze a dataset of tweets/posts with at least 100,000 records within a reasonable time (less than 10 minutes for full analysis).

### 5.2 Security
Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is securely handled and not exposed in the source code.

### 5.3 Usability
The system will be easy to use, especially for data scientists or marketers familiar with Python and data analysis tools.

### 5.4 Maintainability
The system should be modular, allowing for future improvements such as integrating other sentiment analysis models, adding new data sources, or optimizing the performance for large datasets.

### 5.5 Scalability
The system should be able to handle datasets ranging from small (thousands of posts) to large datasets (millions of posts), depending on the available computational resources.

## 6. System Models

### 6.1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
1. **Input**: Social media data (CSV, API)
2. **Process**: 
   - Clean and preprocess text
