# Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

## Description
This project analyzes social media data (tweets) to determine public sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) towards specific topics or brands. It includes data preprocessing, sentiment classification, and visualizations to uncover trends and common themes.

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on social media data, specifically tweets, to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The analysis classifies the sentiment of each tweet into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The results are visualized through charts and word clouds to identify common themes and trends.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses raw social media data by removing URLs, mentions, punctuation, and extra spaces.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies tweets into three sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using the TextBlob library.
- **Sentiment Visualization**: Displays the distribution of sentiments in a bar or pie chart.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Creates word clouds for Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments to highlight frequently used words.
- **Entity Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes sentiment distribution by entities (e.g., brands or topics).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-social-media.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-social-media
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle environment to run the project.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset (CSV file or via API).
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning the text (removing URLs, mentions, special characters).
3. Perform sentiment analysis on the text using TextBlob.
4. Visualize sentiment distribution with bar charts.
5. Generate word clouds for each sentiment category.
6. Optionally, perform entity-based sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in CSV format (e.g., `twitter_training.csv`), which can be uploaded or fetched via API from social media platforms like Twitter.

## Visualizations
- Sentiment Distribution (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Word Clouds for Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments
- Sentiment Analysis by Entities (brands/topics)
